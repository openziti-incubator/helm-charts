This helm chart has been updated to work with a version of traefik that has been configured to allow for the use of ziti when serving prometheus metrics

Configuring the chart

This chart uses the latest version of the zitified verzion of traefik image. See the zitified traefik project for more details
https://github.com/nf-npieros/traefik

Once the zitified traefik image has been created, the appVersion must be changed in Charts.yml to match the version you set when tagging the image

by default the chart is set to use 'prometheuz' as the entrypoint name for prometheus. 
By default, the service name and identity file name are set to 'traefikPrometheus' and 'traefik' respectively. 

In order to change the service name, the following argument can be added to the install
--set ports.prometheuz.serviceName=newServiceName

In order to change the identity name, the following argument can be added to the install

--set ports.prometheuz.identityName=newIdentityName

If you need to change the entry point name, be sure to change all references to .Values.ports.prometheuz.identityName to use your new entry point name in place of prometheuz

The identity file is set using the --set-file flag

to install when using the chart locally the following command can be used

helm install prometheus ./traefik --set-file traefikIdentity=./traefik.json
